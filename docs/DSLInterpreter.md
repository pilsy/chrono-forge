### DSL Structure Rules

1. **Root Element**:
   - The workflow begins with a `root` object, which is always of type `DSLSequence`.
   - `root` contains a single property: `elements`.

2. **Elements**:
   - `elements` is an array that can contain any type of `Statement`, which includes activities, sequences, or parallel blocks.
   - Each `element` in `elements` must be a well-defined `Statement`.

3. **Statement Types**:
   - A `Statement` can be one of the following:
     - `{ activity: DSLActivity }`: Represents a single executable activity.
     - `{ sequence: DSLSequence }`: Represents a sequence of statements that are executed in order.
     - `{ parallel: DSLParallel }`: Represents a set of branches that should be executed in parallel.

4. **Activity Invocation (`DSLActivity`)**:
   - An `activity` object must have:
     - `name`: String representing the function or activity to execute.
     - `arguments`: Array of strings representing the inputs to the activity. These can be literal values or bindings to results of previous activities.
     - `result`: Optional string used to store the output of the activity for use in subsequent activities.

5. **Sequence (`DSLSequence`)**:
   - A `sequence` contains an `elements` array, which holds a list of `Statement` objects to be executed in a specific order.

6. **Parallel (`DSLParallel`)**:
   - A `parallel` contains a `branches` array, where each entry is a `DSLSequence` representing a branch of execution that should occur concurrently with other branches.

### Usage Rules

1. **Execution Order**:
   - In a `sequence`, activities are processed in the order they appear within the `elements` array.
   - In a `parallel`, all sequences defined in the `branches` array start concurrently, and the parallel block completes when all branches have completed.

2. **Data Flow**:
   - Arguments for activities can reference the `result` of earlier activities in the sequence to create dependencies.
   - The `result` of an activity should be uniquely named within the scope of its sequence or parallel block to avoid naming collisions.

3. **Variable Binding**:
   - The `variables` object at the top level can be used to define initial values or bindings that are accessible within the workflow.
   - Variables and results are scoped: results are local to their sequence or parallel block unless explicitly passed to another block.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Errors in any activity should ideally be handled within that activity or reported up to a higher-level handler.
   - In a parallel execution, if one branch fails, it should not automatically cause other branches to fail unless explicitly designed to do so.

5. **Modularity**:
   - Complex workflows should be modularized into smaller sequences and activities where possible to enhance readability and maintainability.
   - Reusable sequences or activities should be defined as separate components or templates if supported by the DSL interpreter.
