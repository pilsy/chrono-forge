#### Phase 2: Robust Error Handling and State Management

6. **Implement Robust Error Handling:**
   - Develop comprehensive error categorization and retry strategies for key operations such as child workflow creation, updates, and deletions.
   - Add compensating transactions and recovery mechanisms in case of critical failures.

7. **Improve State Difference Handling for Nested Entities:**
   - Enhance state comparison and difference calculation logic to support deeply nested entities.
   - Add partial updates, soft deletes, and more sophisticated conflict resolution strategies.

8. **Customize Max Iterations and Continuation Logic:**
   - Provide hooks and extension points to customize `maxIterations` behavior dynamically.
   - Add more granular control over when and how to continue as new workflows.

9. **Optimize Child Workflow Cancellation and Cleanup:**
   - Develop advanced cleanup and rollback procedures for canceled child workflows.
   - Ensure proper management of orphaned workflows and potential race conditions.

10. **Enhance State Normalization and Consistency:**
    - Add checks to ensure consistency in the normalized state.
    - Handle potential schema changes dynamically and ensure backward compatibility.
