#### Phase 1: Core Enhancements and Feature Completion

1. **Enhance Managed Paths Handling:**
   - Implement comprehensive logic for configuring managed paths, including nested and complex entities.
   - Ensure auto-start of child workflows based on different configurations (`autoStartChildren`).
   - Add handling for dynamically modifying managed paths and managing conflicts.

2. **Improve Subscription Management:**
   - Add comprehensive support for handling overlapping subscriptions, cascading unsubscribes, and error management when workflows are unavailable.
   - Implement retry mechanisms and backoff strategies for failed signals and workflow connections.

3. **Expand Signal Handling for Child Workflows:**
   - Add robust support for forwarding and handling custom signals for child workflows.
   - Implement retry and fallback mechanisms for signaling failures.
   - Provide customization points for signals specific to child workflow types.

4. **Enhance Condition Handling:**
   - Implement advanced condition expressions for waiting on multiple conditions.
   - Provide a mechanism for dynamically updating conditions and expressions during the workflow execution.

5. **Develop Custom Data Loading Logic:**
   - Flesh out the `loadData` function to support different data sources, caching mechanisms, and paginated data retrieval.
   - Ensure seamless integration with the state management process.
