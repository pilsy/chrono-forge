### **Workflow Class Features**

The `Workflow` class in ChronoForge provides a set of foundational features that are essential for defining, managing, and executing workflows in the Temporal environment. These features include signal and query management, execution control, lifecycle hooks, and error handling. Together, they form the core capabilities that every workflow needs to interact with Temporal's orchestration engine effectively.

This document describes each of these features in detail and provides links to more in-depth sections for developers who want to explore each aspect further.

#### **1. Signal Handling**

Signals are a powerful way to interact with running workflows asynchronously. They allow external systems or other workflows to send messages to a workflow, triggering specific behaviors or updating the workflow's state. The `Workflow` class provides built-in support for signal handling through the use of the [`@Signal` decorator](./signal_decorator.md).

- **Purpose**: Handle asynchronous notifications and events sent to workflows.
- **Key Methods**: Define signal handlers using methods decorated with `@Signal`.
- **Usage Example**:

  ```typescript
  import { Workflow, Signal } from 'temporal-forge';

  @Temporal()
  export class ExampleWorkflow extends Workflow {
    @Signal()
    async updateStatus(newStatus: string): Promise<void> {
      // Signal handling logic
    }
  }
  ```

- **Detailed Documentation**: See [Signal Handling](./signal_handling.md) for more information on defining signals, handling them, and best practices for signal usage.

#### **2. Query Handling**

Queries provide a synchronous way to retrieve information from a running workflow. They are useful for getting the current state or computed values without altering the workflow's state. The `Workflow` class facilitates query handling with the [`@Query` decorator](./query_decorator.md).

- **Purpose**: Retrieve data from a running workflow synchronously without modifying the state.
- **Key Methods**: Define query handlers using methods decorated with `@Query`.
- **Usage Example**:

  ```typescript
  import { Workflow, Query } from 'temporal-forge';

  @Temporal()
  export class ExampleWorkflow extends Workflow {
    @Query()
    getStatus(): string {
      return this.status;
    }
  }
  ```

- **Detailed Documentation**: See [Query Handling](./query_handling.md) for more details on how to use queries, handle query results, and optimize performance.

#### **3. Execution Control and Flow Management**

The `Workflow` class provides methods for managing the workflow's execution lifecycle, allowing developers to control how workflows start, pause, resume, and complete. This control is critical for managing workflows that involve complex logic or require coordination with other workflows or external systems.

- **Purpose**: Manage the lifecycle and flow of workflow execution, including starting, pausing, and terminating workflows.
- **Key Methods**: `execute`, `pause`, `resume`, and custom lifecycle methods.
- **Usage Example**:

  ```typescript
  import { Workflow } from 'temporal-forge';

  @Temporal()
  export class ExampleWorkflow extends Workflow {
    async execute(params: any): Promise<void> {
      // Workflow execution logic
    }
  }
  ```

- **Detailed Documentation**: See [Execution Control and Flow Management](./execution_control.md) for a comprehensive guide on workflow lifecycle management, including best practices and common patterns.

#### **4. Error Handling with `@OnError`**

Error handling is a crucial aspect of building reliable and resilient workflows. The `Workflow` class provides robust error handling mechanisms using the [`@OnError` decorator](./error_handling.md), which allows developers to define custom error handlers for specific methods or for the entire workflow.

- **Purpose**: Manage errors that occur during workflow execution, ensuring that workflows can recover gracefully or fail cleanly.
- **Key Methods**: Define error handlers using methods decorated with `@OnError`.
- **Usage Example**:

  ```typescript
  import { Workflow, OnError } from 'temporal-forge';

  @Temporal()
  export class ExampleWorkflow extends Workflow {
    @OnError('execute')
    protected async handleError(err: Error): Promise<void> {
      console.error('Error during execution:', err);
    }
  }
  ```

- **Detailed Documentation**: See [Error Handling with `@OnError`](./error_handling.md) for more information on defining error handlers, managing retries, and best practices for error handling.

#### **5. Lifecycle Management Hooks**

Lifecycle hooks provide a way to intercept key moments in a workflow's execution, such as before or after specific methods are called. This feature allows developers to inject custom logic, logging, or monitoring code at critical points in the workflow lifecycle.

- **Purpose**: Run custom logic at specific points during workflow execution, such as before or after a method is executed.
- **Key Methods**: Define lifecycle hooks using the `@Hook` decorator (speculative).
- **Usage Example**:

  ```typescript
  import { Workflow, Hook } from 'temporal-forge';

  @Temporal()
  export class ExampleWorkflow extends Workflow {
    @Hook({ before: 'execute' })
    protected async logBeforeExecution() {
      console.log('Before executing...');
    }
  }
  ```

- **Detailed Documentation**: See [Lifecycle Management Hooks](./lifecycle_hooks.md) for more details on how to use hooks to manage workflow behavior dynamically.

### **Conclusion**

The `Workflow` class in ChronoForge provides a robust foundation for creating and managing Temporal workflows. By leveraging its key features—signal and query handling, execution control, error management, and lifecycle hooks—developers can build complex workflows that are reliable, maintainable, and scalable. Each of these features is described in more detail in the corresponding sections, providing developers with the guidance they need to use the `Workflow` class effectively.
