## Introduction to ChronoForge

ChronoForge enhances Temporal's workflow engine by providing developers with a set of tools and abstractions to manage complex workflows in a declarative and flexible way. Whether you're building a system that handles hierarchical task management, real-time data synchronization, or a robust microservice orchestration platform, ChronoForge provides the building blocks necessary to manage stateful workflows effectively.

ChronoForge consists of two primary classes:

- **Workflow Class**: The foundational class that provides core features for handling signals, queries, error management, and lifecycle hooks.
- **StatefulWorkflow Class**: An extension of the `Workflow` class, adding powerful state management capabilities, automatic child workflow orchestration, dynamic subscription handling, and more.

For a quick introduction, see the [Overview](./docs/Workflow/overview.md) documentation, which provides a high-level overview of the `Workflow` class and its role in the ChronoForge framework.

## Installation

To get started with ChronoForge, install it via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install chrono-forge
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add chrono-forge
```

ChronoForge requires Node.js 14 or later and integrates seamlessly with Temporal.io's TypeScript SDK.

## Getting Started

ChronoForge offers a streamlined approach to creating both basic and stateful workflows. Below are examples demonstrating the use of the frameworkâ€™s features.

### Workflow Example

A basic workflow in ChronoForge utilizes the `@ChronoFlow` decorator along with various step and signal decorators to define its logic:

```typescript
import { ChronoFlow, Workflow } from 'chrono-forge';

@ChronoFlow()
export class SimpleWorkflow extends Workflow {
  protected async execute() {
    this.log.info('Executing workflow...');
  }
}

export default SimpleWorkflow;
```

### Stateful Workflow Example

ChronoForge also supports stateful workflows that manage normalized state across executions:

```typescript
import { StatefulWorkflow, Property, Signal, Query, Before, Hook, ContinueAsNew } from 'chrono-forge';
import schemas, { MyEntity } from "@schemas"

@ChronoFlow({
  schema: MyEntity,
  schemas,
})
class MyStatefulWorkflow extends StatefulWorkflow {
  protected async execute() {
    this.log.info('Executing stateful workflow...');
  }
}

export default MyStatefulWorkflow;
```

`src/schema/index.ts`

```typescript
import { SchemaManager } from '../SchemaManager';

const schemaManager = SchemaManager.getInstance();

schemaManager.setSchemas({
  MyEntity: {
    idAttribute: 'id',
    myOtherEntity: ['MyOtherEntity']
  },
  MyOtherEntity: {
    idAttribute: 'id',
    myEntity: 'MyEntity'
  }
});

const schemas = schemaManager.getSchemas();
const { MyEntity, MyOtherEntity } = schemas;
export { MyEntity, MyOtherEntity };
export default schemas;
```

In this example, `MyStatefulWorkflow` handles normalized state using the `normalizr` library, allowing for complex state management across multiple executions.

## Core Concepts and Features

### Workflow Class

The `Workflow` class serves as the base class for defining Temporal workflows in ChronoForge. It provides essential features such as signal and query handling, error management with decorators, and lifecycle hooks for executing custom logic at different stages of workflow execution. The `Workflow` class is designed to be extended, allowing developers to define workflows that leverage Temporal's capabilities while integrating ChronoForge's advanced features.

- **Signal Handling**: Real-time communication with running workflows using the `@Signal` decorator. For details, see [Signal Handling](./docs/Workflow/signal_handling.md).
- **Query Handling**: Retrieve workflow state or computed values using the `@Query` decorator. Learn more in [Query Handling](./docs/Workflow/query_handling.md).
- **Update Handling**: Update workflow state using the `@Action` decorator. Learn more in [Update Handling](./docs/Workflow/update_handling.md).

- **Error Handling**: Robust error management using the `@OnError` decorator to define custom error handlers. Detailed examples are provided in [Error Handling with `@OnError`](./docs/Workflow/error_handling.md).
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Inject custom logic before or after specific methods using the `@Hook` decorator. See [Lifecycle Management Hooks](./docs/Workflow/lifecycle_hooks.md) for more information.
- **Execution Control**: Manage the workflow execution lifecycle with methods like `execute`, which allow workflows to be paused, resumed, or terminated. For insights into managing long-running workflows, see [Execution Control and Flow Management](./docs/Workflow/execution_control.md).

The comprehensive breakdown of the `Workflow` class features can be found in the [Workflow Class Features](./docs/Workflow/features.md) section.

### StatefulWorkflow Class

The `StatefulWorkflow` class extends the `Workflow` class by introducing advanced state management capabilities and automatic orchestration of child workflows. This class is ideal for workflows that require managing complex states, such as nested workflows, dynamic data loading, and API integration.

- **State Management**: Manage and normalize workflow state using schemas. For an in-depth guide, see [State Management and Data Normalization](./docs/StatefulWorkflow/state_management_and_data_normalization.md).
- **Child Workflow Management**: Automatically manage child workflows' lifecycles. Details can be found in [Child Workflow Lifecycle Management](./docs/StatefulWorkflow/child_workflow_lifecycle_management.md).
- **Dynamic Subscription Handling**: Dynamically handle subscriptions to state changes within workflows. For more information, refer to [Dynamic Subscription Handling](./docs/StatefulWorkflow/subscriptions_and_signal_based_communication.md).
- **Error Handling and Recovery**: Error management strategies for complex workflows are discussed in [Error Handling with `@OnError`](./docs/Workflow/error_handling.md).

A complete overview of the `StatefulWorkflow` class and its features is available in the [StatefulWorkflow Class Features](./docs/StatefulWorkflow/getting_started.md) section.
